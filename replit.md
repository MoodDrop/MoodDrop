# MoodDrop - Emotional Wellness & Growth Platform

## Overview
MoodDrop is a fully anonymous emotional wellness platform designed as a safe space for users to express emotions via text or voice. No sign-up or authentication requiredâ€”users select from 5 color-coded moods (Calm, Grounded, Joyful, Tender, Overwhelmed), click "ðŸ’§ Drop It" to access a dedicated journaling page with Write or Voice tabs, practice guided breathing exercises, and access comfort resources and interactive games. The platform features a mobile-first design with calming animations, accessibility-first interactions, and localStorage-only storage. Its core purpose is to foster emotional wellness and personal growth through immediate, anonymous support.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes
### Homepage Redesign & CSV Removal (October 30, 2025)
- **Simplified User Flow**: Homepage now features 5 mood circles (reduced from 6, removed Frustrated) â†’ "ðŸ’§ Drop It" button â†’ dedicated /drop-it page for journaling
- **Mood Selection**: 5 color-coded moods: Calm (blue #A6C8FF), Grounded (green #A4C3A2), Joyful (yellow #FBE694), Tender (peach #F6C1B4), Overwhelmed (gray #C9C7D2)
- **DropItPage**: New dedicated page for journaling with two tabs: "Write" (text input with affirmation) and "Voice" (60s audio recording). Mood stored in localStorage, cleared after successful submission
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks for localStorage operations, user-friendly error messages, FileReader error handling
- **CSV Removal**: Removed all CSV import/export functionality from MyDropsPage. Updated privacy footnote to: "Private to this device. Your drops stay on your device only â€” fully anonymous."
- **State Management**: Mood selection persisted via localStorage ("mooddrop_selected_mood"), automatically cleared after drop submission to prevent stale context
- **Enhanced UX**: Back button navigation, mood display on drop page, smooth tab transitions, automatic redirect after submission

### Take a Breath Breathing Exercise & Anonymous Mode (October 2025)
- **Fully Anonymous Platform**: Removed all authentication requirementsâ€”no sign-up, login, or account needed. Admin routes preserved but hidden from navigation
- **Take a Breath Page**: Replaced "Drop What You're Doing" with guided breathing exercises featuring three scientifically-backed presets:
  - **Box Breathing**: 4s inhale, 4s hold, 4s exhale, 4s hold (stress reduction, focus)
  - **4-7-8 Breathing**: 4s inhale, 7s hold, 8s exhale (sleep aid, anxiety relief)
  - **Long Exhale (Calming)**: 4s inhale, 6s exhale (nervous system regulation)
- **Visual Ring Animation**: Expanding/contracting ring synchronized with breath phases (blue on inhale, yellow on exhale, gray on hold). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` with fallback to static progress indicator
- **Interactive Controls**: Start/Pause/Reset buttons with keyboard shortcuts (Spacebar to toggle, Enter to reset). Optional sound toggle (off by default) with gentle breath-chime audio
- **Phase Labels & Progress**: Real-time phase display ("Breathe in", "Hold", "Breathe out") with live countdown and visual progress ring driven by requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA live regions for screen readers, keyboard navigation, reduced-motion support, graceful audio fallback if sound file missing
- **Coming Soon Pages**: Dashboard and Garden now show "Coming Soon" placeholders with messaging: "Optional accounts for saved progress and tracking are on the way. For now, everything is fully anonymous"
- **Unlocked Games**: Removed "(Sign up)" text from locked games (Color Drift, Zen Garden) in Find Your Calmâ€”they simply show lock icon
- **Routes Updated**: `/release` and `/breathe` both navigate to breathing exercise. Header navigation renamed to "Take a Breath"


### Previous Updates
- **Release Page Affirmation Fix**: Resolved critical bug where affirmation failed to display after message submission. Fixed by using React Query's `onSuccess` callback pattern instead of async/await for reliable state updates
- **Bubble Pop Game Sound**: Added gentle popping sound effect when bubbles are clicked. Audio element initialized with error handling for graceful fallback if sound file missing
- **Soothing Sounds Tab**: Restored tab with "Coming Soon" message featuring Music2 icon, centered text, and soft blush/cream gradient background
- **Production Readiness**: All features tested and verified via comprehensive end-to-end testing
