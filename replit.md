# MoodDrop - Emotional Wellness & Growth Platform

## Overview

MoodDrop is a full-stack web application that provides a safe space for users to express their emotions through text or voice messages. The platform has evolved from anonymous-only to supporting user accounts while maintaining anonymous posting capability. Users share feelings, receive supportive affirmations, access comfort resources, and watch their emotional journey bloom in a visual Mood Garden. The platform features a clean mobile-first design, comprehensive admin moderation tools, engagement features (streaks, insights, favorites), and persistent PostgreSQL database storage for production reliability.
