1️⃣ Homepage Layout

Keep the homepage hero, header, and tagline exactly as they are.

The section title “What type of mood are you feeling today?” remains centered directly above the mood color circles.

2️⃣ Animated Interaction Hint

Place a gentle instruction line below “What type of mood are you feeling today?” and above the colored mood circles:

✨ Choose a mood to begin…

Font style:

text-sm, text-zinc-500 (or a soft beige tone that matches MoodDrop’s background).

Center-aligned.

Light fade-in on page load.

Animation Behavior

Every 4–5 seconds, the text should fade in and out smoothly (opacity 0.6 → 1.0 → 0.6).

Duration: 2–3 seconds, ease-in-out transition.

The animation should feel calm and unintrusive — no harsh blinking or jerky movement.

Once a user selects a mood circle, the line fades out completely and remains hidden.

3️⃣ Mood Circle Glow Animation

Each mood circle should have a slow, rhythmic glow to suggest it’s clickable.

Apply a soft box-shadow pulse animation:

Duration: 3–5 seconds.

Repeat: infinite.

Opacity range: from 0 → 0.2 → 0.

Color: a slightly lighter tone of each circle’s base color.

The glow animation should pause when the user hovers or clicks a circle.
4️⃣ User Interaction Flow

When a mood circle is clicked:

The ✨ “Choose a mood to begin…” text fades out.

The selected mood name + meaning appear (as they currently do).

The “Write it out” panel then opens smoothly beneath the mood description.

The panel stays hidden until a mood is selected.

5️⃣ Restore Voice Note Flow (Under “Take a Moment”)

Within the “Take a Moment” tab:

When a mood circle is clicked, show the selected mood color, name, and meaning (same as the “Write It Out” tab).

Instead of the text box, display a Voice Note panel with:

🎤 Record, ⏹ Stop, ▶️ Play, and ❌ Delete buttons.

Maximum recording length: 60 seconds.

Display a live timer (MM:SS) while recording.

Store audio locally only (no upload or backend connection yet).

Reset Mood hides the voice panel and deselects the mood.

Accessibility:

Support keyboard shortcuts — Spacebar toggles Record/Stop.

Design:

Rounded, soft blush/neutral buttons.

Subtle shadows and centered layout.

Match existing MoodDrop aesthetic for consistency.

✅ Done Criteria

Homepage layout remains unchanged.

The ✨ “Choose a mood to begin…” line gently animates and disappears after selection.

Mood circles have a calm glowing pulse that pauses on interaction.

“Write it out” appears only when a mood is chosen.

“Take a Moment” tab shows a working Voice Note panel with recording, playback, and reset features.
