Replace Tab with Take a Breath
1) Tab & Routing

Rename the “Drop What You’re Doing” tab to “Take a Breath.”

Keep the tab in the same position in navigation; route stays the same path if possible (redirect old path → new tab).

2) Purpose & UX

A gentle, one-screen breathing aid to help users regulate before writing or recording.

Minimal card centered on the page.

Soft, calm visuals; no sign-up required.

Works offline; no backend calls.

3) Presets (selector at top of card)

Provide three presets the user can choose:

Box Breathing — Inhale 4 • Hold 4 • Exhale 4 • Hold 4

4-7-8 — Inhale 4 • Hold 7 • Exhale 8

Long Exhale — Inhale 4 • Exhale 6 (no holds)

Default preset: Box Breathing.

4) Visual Guidance (ring animation)

A circular ring that expands/contracts to guide breathing.

Phase labels below the ring, updating live: Inhale / Hold / Exhale / Hold.

Animation is gentle (ease-in-out, 1500–2000ms per 4 count).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion:

If enabled, pause animation and show a static progress bar + text cues only.

5) Controls

Start / Pause / Reset buttons (large, rounded, subtle shadows).

Keyboard shortcuts:

Space → Start/Pause

Enter → Reset

Announce phase changes for screen readers:
aria-live="polite" (e.g., “Inhale for 4”, “Hold for 4”, “Exhale for 4”).

6) Copy & Hints

Title: Take a Breath

Small caption under title (muted text):
“Follow the ring or the cues below.”

Under the controls, show the current preset formula (e.g., “Inhale 4 • Hold 4 • Exhale 4 • Hold 4”).

7) Optional Sound (off by default)

Soft, very low-volume chime at phase changes (toggle switch: Sound on/off; default off).

File suggestion (hosted as static): /public/sounds/breath-chime.mp3, volume ~ 0.15.

No autoplay; only when session running.

8) Styling

Match MoodDrop palette (blush/cream/neutral).

Card: rounded-2xl, soft shadow, generous padding.

Ring uses a gentle gradient or subtle glow; avoid harsh colors.

9) Mobile

Ring scales to fit small screens (min 220–260px).

Controls stack vertically with comfortable touch targets.

10) Non-goals (do NOT add)

No timers, achievements, or streaks here.

No sign-up/login prompts.

11) Done Criteria

Tab reads “Take a Breath” and opens a breathing card.

Preset selector switches the cycle correctly and updates labels.

Start/Pause/Reset work; keyboard shortcuts work.

Ring animation smooth; honors prefers-reduced-motion.

Optional sound toggle works (off by default).

No console errors; fully usable on mobile.

Remove Sign-Up (Anonymous by Default) + Keep Admin
1) Disable user sign-up / log-in (front & back)

Hide or remove all Sign Up / Log In buttons and routes from the public UI.

Remove any auth guards/redirects that block access to:

Let It Flow (write)

Take a Moment (voice notes)

Games (Bubble Pop / Matching)

Soothing Sounds / Watch & Smile (if present)

If there’s any auth middleware (e.g., Next.js middleware, Supabase session checks), bypass it for public routes.

Copy hint (small, muted text near the mood circles):

“No account needed — everything here is anonymous.”

2) Keep Admin (private)

Preserve the admin route (e.g., /admin) for owner use only.

Protect admin with one of:

Simple password gate via env var (ADMIN_PASS) or

IP allow list (if applicable).

Ensure no admin APIs or data endpoints are exposed to anonymous users.

If Supabase is wired, keep RLS enabled; do not require user auth for public views.

3) Remove/disable auth calls that cause errors

Remove any client calls like supabase.auth.getUser() or signUp() in public flows.

Remove 404/redirects for /signup, /auth, /profile.

If a component expects user, make it optional and default to anonymous state.

4) Voice notes & Write It Out remain local

Voice notes: record/playback locally only (no upload).

Write It Out: show text area only after a mood is selected; no persistence.

Keep Reset mood behavior (don’t clear typed text unless the user taps “Clear”).

5) Mood Garden / saving features (future-ready)

If “Mood Garden” or “Track Progress” exists, switch to Coming Soon / Optional (requires account).

Do not prompt to sign up now; just show a calm placeholder card.

6) Visual tweaks (small)

Where the Sign Up button used to be, either remove it or replace with subtle text:

“Accounts coming later for optional saved progress.”

Keep the current homepage layout, palette, and animations unchanged.

7) QA checklist (Done criteria)

Public users can use all core features without any auth prompt or error.

No broken links to /signup, /login, or /profile.

Admin route works and is not discoverable from main navigation.

Voice + Write flows work exactly as before, fully anonymous.

Mood Garden (if visible) shows Coming Soon (no sign-up).

Lighthouse/console shows no auth errors on public pages.
