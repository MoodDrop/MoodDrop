Context (don’t change):

App is a Vite + React + Tailwind SPA using wouter for routing.

Local drops are stored only on the device under the key mooddrop_messages.

Keep all existing functionality of the composer (mood picker, Reset, textarea, mic toggle if present, and Drop It saving behavior).

Do not add Next.js or server changes. No DB.

Keep /my-drops page and existing View My Drops behavior.

Goal:
Update the Home page to the new structure + tone and add a Calm Studio landing route (stub). Replace “Find Your Calm” in the top nav with “Calm Studio”. Do not show a View My Drops button at the top hero; keep the View My Drops button under the Drop It area (as it is now) but restyle to the new look.

1) Update Navigation

In the navbar component (where links are defined), rename “Find Your Calm” → “Calm Studio” and point it to route /calm-studio.

Keep the rest of the nav items and routing unchanged.

2) Home Page Layout & Copy

Locate the Home page component (usually client/src/pages/Home.tsx or client/src/pages/index.tsx). Replace the hero area and reorganize sections as below. Keep existing Tailwind theme tokens you’ve been using (e.g., bg-cream-50, text-warm-gray-900, border-blush-100, etc).

Hero (top section):

Show the droplet lockup you already use (the light droplet tile).

Replace headline & subcopy with:

Headline:
Welcome to MoodDrop

Tagline:
Your quiet corner to release, reflect, and grow through every mood.

Remove any extra “View My Drops” button from the hero. No action buttons here.

Mood Picker Row (unchanged behavior):

Keep the 6 mood circles, same order, same colors, same selection behavior/preview line (the small “Grounded · …” line).

Drop Composer Section:

Keep the two tabs Let It Flow and Take a Moment (if present) with same behavior.

Keep the mood chip with Reset on the right.

Keep the textarea & mic button exactly as they work now.

Primary button: Rename label to “Drop It Here” and prepend the droplet icon. Keep the same Tailwind colors (large, rounded, warm peach background).

Under the button, keep the reassurance line:
Your words stay on your device — private, safe, and yours.

CTAs under composer (centered):

View My Drops — rounded, with the small droplet icon at the left (use the new nicer style — slightly elevated card/button look). Route: /my-drops.

Calm Studio — sibling button, rounded, slightly elevated; icon: simple smile/zen face or sparkle; Route: /calm-studio.

On mobile: stack; on tablet/desktop: sit side-by-side.

Do not remove or change the localStorage key or how dropping/saving works.

3) Add Calm Studio Route (Stub Only)

Create client/src/pages/CalmStudio.tsx and register route /calm-studio with wouter.

Page contents:

Title: Calm Studio

Subcopy: A small collection of soothing tools. More coming soon.

A simple responsive grid of 4–5 cards (all “Coming soon” for now):

Soundscapes (coming soon)

Breathing (coming soon)

Watch & Smile (coming soon)

Affirmations (coming soon)

(optional) Mini Games (coming soon)

Each card = rounded, soft border, subtle shadow, icon, short one-line description, a small “Coming soon” pill. No functionality; they’re just placeholders.

Do not change /my-drops. Do not surface a Mood Garden here.

4) Styling Requirements

Maintain your warm palette and existing Tailwind tokens: bg-cream-50, text-warm-gray-900/600, border-blush-100, etc.

Buttons & cards use soft shadows, rounded-2xl, generous padding, and hover transitions.

Fully responsive: mobile first; hero text centered; CTAs stack on mobile.

5) Routing (wouter)

Ensure routes exist: / → Home, /my-drops (existing), /calm-studio (new).

Update any top-level router switch accordingly. Don’t touch other pages.

6) Accessibility

All buttons have aria-labels.

Mood picker circles keep aria-pressed or role where relevant.

The mic button (if present) has a clear label.

7) Acceptance Criteria

The homepage shows the new headline and tagline (exact text above).

No “View My Drops” button appears in the hero.

The “Drop It Here” button (with droplet icon) sits above the reassurance line, and below that are the two CTAs: View My Drops and Calm Studio.

Nav shows Calm Studio instead of “Find Your Calm”, and /calm-studio loads a grid of “Coming soon” cards.

/my-drops and saving drops keep working exactly as before (local only).

No new frameworks or servers added.

When finished, run locally and confirm:

/ loads with the new layout & copy.

Dropping still saves to localStorage.

Buttons route correctly to /my-drops and /calm-studio.

If you need to create or rename files, follow the existing folder pattern under client/src/pages/ and update the app router where routes are defined. Keep the rest of the codebase intact.
