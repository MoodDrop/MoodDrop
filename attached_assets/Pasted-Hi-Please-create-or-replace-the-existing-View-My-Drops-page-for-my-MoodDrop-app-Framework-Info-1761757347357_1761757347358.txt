Hi! Please create or replace the existing View My Drops page for my MoodDrop app.

🔹 Framework Info:

My app uses Vite + React (React Router) — not Next.js.

The route for this page should be /my-drops and connect to the existing “View My Drops” button on my homepage.

If a previous file for “View My Drops” exists, please replace it completely with this new version.

Save it in client/src/pages/MyDropsPage.tsx.

🔹 Core Features:

Load saved “drops” from localStorage using the key moodDrops, or fallback mooddrop_messages.

Each drop should show:

The date (formatted like “Oct 29, 8:35 PM”)

The emotion (e.g., Calm, Anxious, Grateful)

The text of the drop

Display each entry inside a rounded white card with a soft blush/cream background that matches the MoodDrop color palette (blush, warm gray, cream tones).

Add a small Delete button beside each drop.

When deleted, show an Undo option at the top with the message: “Drop deleted. Undo?”

If no drops exist, show this centered message:

“No drops yet. After you press Drop It, they’ll appear here.”

Include a soft ← Back link at the top that returns to the homepage.

Make everything mobile-friendly with generous spacing and smooth transitions.

🔹 Mood Garden Visualization Mode (below the list):

Create a soft animated “Mood Garden” section that displays one flower or petal icon per mood.

The color of each flower represents the emotion (for example: Calm = soft blue, Grateful = gold, Anxious = muted gray).

Use framer-motion (already installed) for gentle animations — floating or blooming effect.

The flowers should fade in and gently move when the page loads.

Show a small title above it: “Your Mood Garden 🌸”

Add a tooltip when hovering (or tapping) on a flower to show the date and emotion.

🔹 Design Notes:

Match the existing MoodDrop style: warm-gray text, cream background, blush highlights, rounded corners, soft drop shadows.

Keep it minimal, peaceful, and beautiful — not cluttered.

Ensure both the list view and Mood Garden adjust nicely on small screens.

Thank you!
