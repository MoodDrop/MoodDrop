📘 TITLE

Add New Mood: Crash Out 💨 (Venting & Release)

🧠 GOAL

Introduce a new mood called “Crash Out” using the 💨 emoji to symbolize venting, emotional release, or that moment of letting go.
It should fit seamlessly with existing moods in both design and function.

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

“Crash Out 💨” appears as an option in the mood selector.

Selecting “Crash Out 💨” highlights it with a soft blue tone.

Mood value saves with each drop (localStorage).

Feels cohesive with Calm / Reflective / Tender styles.

No layout or spacing issues on mobile view.

📁 FILES TO EDIT

client/src/components/DropComposer.tsx (or DropIt.tsx — whichever has the mood array)

If moods are centralized: client/src/lib/constants/moods.ts

🧩 IMPLEMENTATION

1️⃣ Locate your existing moods array in the composer or constants file.

2️⃣ Add the new mood:

const moods = [
  { emoji: "💧", label: "Calm", color: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-700" },
  { emoji: "🌷", label: "Tender", color: "bg-pink-100 text-pink-700" },
  { emoji: "🌿", label: "Grounded", color: "bg-green-100 text-green-700" },
  { emoji: "🌙", label: "Reflective", color: "bg-amber-100 text-amber-700" },
  { emoji: "✨", label: "Hopeful", color: "bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700" },

  // 💨 NEW MOOD
  { emoji: "💨", label: "Crash Out", color: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-700" },
];


💡 Tip: If your composer displays these moods dynamically (like grid buttons or dropdown), this new one will auto-appear with the same style.

🎨 DESIGN NOTES

Mood meaning: release, venting, exhale.
Emotion tone: tired but peaceful.
Visual tone: soft blue background with navy text (gentle, airy vibe).

This keeps “Crash Out 💨” visually aligned with “Calm 💧” while conveying a more expressive, venting emotion.

🧪 QA CHECKLIST

 Selected mood highlights with ring-2 ring-blue-200.

 Saved mood persists in localStorage with post data.

 Works across desktop and mobile layouts.

 Feeds (Community, View My Drops) display the emoji properly.

 No console errors (especially for mood type definitions).
