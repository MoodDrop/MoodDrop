Please make the following changes in my Vite/React app so “View My Drops” only appears under the “Drop It” section (not at the top of the homepage), and fix a crash in the My Drops page when a mood color is missing.

1) Home page (client/src/pages/index.tsx)

a. Remove the top CTA block
Find the CTA buttons directly under the “Choose a mood to begin…” line that render:

“View My Drops”

“Find Your Calm”

Delete that entire top CTA block so those buttons no longer appear near the top of the page.

b. Replace the lower “View My Drops” link (under the Drop It button) with the new droplet-style button
Still in index.tsx, locate the small “View My Drops” link that appears under the “Drop It” button and replace that anchor with this exact JSX:

<div className="mt-3 flex justify-center">
  <a
    href="/my-drops"
    className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-2xl border border-blush-100 bg-cream-50 px-4 py-2 text-warm-gray-800 shadow-sm hover:bg-cream-100 transition"
  >
    <span className="text-sky-500">💧</span>
    <span className="font-medium">View My Drops</span>
  </a>
</div>


Do not add any other “View My Drops” buttons elsewhere on the homepage.

2) My Drops page crash fix (client/src/pages/MyDropsPage.tsx)

The runtime overlay shows: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'color') at the line that renders a small colored dot using mood.color.
Some entries don’t have a mood object, only an emotion string, so the lookup is undefined. Add a safe color resolver and use it when rendering the dot.

a. Add this helper above the component (or near other constants):

const EMOTION_COLORS: Record<string, string> = {
  Grounded: "#86efac",  // green-300
  Calm:     "#93c5fd",  // sky-300
  Joyful:   "#fde68a",  // amber-300
  Reflective:"#fca5a5", // red-300 (example)
  Anxious:  "#c7d2fe",  // indigo-200
  // add other emotions as needed
};

function getMoodColor(emotion?: string) {
  return EMOTION_COLORS[emotion ?? ""] ?? "#94a3b8"; // fallback: zinc-400
}


b. Replace the colored-dot style to use the resolver.
Find the <div className="w-6 h-6 rounded-full flex-shrink-0" style={{ backgroundColor: mood.color }} /> (or similar) and replace its style prop with:

style={{ backgroundColor: getMoodColor(m.emotion) }}


Make no other changes to the layout and keep the rest of the page logic intact.

3) Routing

Ensure the button under “Drop It” still navigates to /my-drops (no routing changes beyond the button above).

After edits, rebuild and run the dev server.
