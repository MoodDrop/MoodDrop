Rebuild the homepage to match the provided screenshot and updated copy — a clean, welcoming interface that encourages users to choose their mood, write, or speak. Simplify the layout and remove unnecessary buttons (Import/Export CSV).

🪶 Instructions for Replit
Rebuild the MoodDrop homepage with the following exact updates and design:

🌸 GENERAL SETUP
--------------------------------
• Keep the existing warm cream background and minimalist layout.
• Do NOT add or modify frameworks — stay with Vite + React + TypeScript.
• Remove all Import/Export CSV buttons globally (including MyDropsPage).
• Maintain current typography, color palette, and mood circle colors.

📄 HOMEPAGE LAYOUT
--------------------------------
Title: “Welcome to MoodDrop”

Subtitle: 
“A gentle space to release your thoughts, find calm, and grow through every mood.”

Immediately below the subtitle, add a new line of text:
“Release your thoughts through typing or voice notes, unwind with calming games and soothing videos.”

Below that, keep the line:
“Choose your mood to begin…”

Then display the five mood dots (blue, green, yellow, gray, peach) as shown in the screenshot.

Button:
- Replace “Drop It Here” with **“💧 Drop It”**
- Keep the button shape, size, and color identical to the screenshot.
- Keep the subtext line under it:
  “Let it out — this space is just for you.”

Below that, keep or reintroduce:
“Type or speak your thoughts — every drop helps you grow. Your words stay on your device —”

And finally, retain the two small links at the bottom:
“🌿 Open Calm Studio” | “💧 View My Drops”

📄 FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------
- The “Drop It” button leads users to the writing/recording page (DropItPage.tsx).
- The selected mood color should carry over to the writing interface.
- Voice note recording must remain supported (via browser mic).
- LocalStorage still stores:
  • mood
  • text or voice note
  • timestamp
- Remove all CSV import/export buttons in every route.

📂 FILES TO UPDATE
--------------------------------
- client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (main structure and text changes)
- client/src/pages/DropItPage.tsx (ensure smooth transition)
- client/src/pages/MyDropsPage.tsx (remove Import/Export CSV)
- client/src/App.tsx (ensure routing to DropIt and ViewMyDrops is correct)

🎨 STYLE NOTES
--------------------------------
- Keep rounded corners and soft shadows for buttons.
- Keep droplet icon in **blue** to match MoodDrop’s brand palette.
- Maintain generous white space for calm, breathable design.
- No new animations required yet; just polish transitions if possible.

✅ END RESULT
--------------------------------
Homepage visually matches the provided screenshot, but includes:
- Updated subtitle copy:
  “Release your thoughts through typing or voice notes, unwind with calming games and soothing videos.”
- Button text changed to “💧 Drop It”
- No Import/Export CSV buttons
- Clean, minimal layout that flows naturally into Drop It and Calm Studio.

Do not change routing, frameworks, or dependencies.
