Everything looks great overall — thank you for the ongoing updates.

Please make the following changes and cleanups related to the video sections in Need Comfort:

Technical details:

Use a centered layout for the video.

Apply soft rounded corners (border-radius: 16px) and a faint shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)).

Keep the background clean and softly blended with MoodDrop’s color palette.

Add a short fade-in or slide-up animation when the video loads.

Future flexibility:

Leave room to easily add more Story Time videos later (e.g., in a scrollable list or grid).

Make sure the Story Time tab continues to flow smoothly with the rest of the “Need Comfort” section navigation.

Place this wording somewhere when you click on Watch & Smile
 “Follow and support these amazing creators for more heartfelt, funny, and relatable storytimes that remind us we’re all human.” 

Implementation details:

Embed the video using a responsive iframe that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.

Keep the design consistent with MoodDrop’s soft, minimalist aesthetic — blush, cream, and nude tones with subtle shadows and rounded corners.

Caption and text content:

1️⃣ Story Time Tab:

Remove the unavailable video currently showing.

Add this new video:

Video Details:

Keep layout centered and responsive with rounded corners and soft blush tones.

Include a short supportive line beneath:
“Follow and support these amazing creators for more heartfelt, funny, and relatable storytimes.”

Add a small sparkle or heart icon next to “creators” for warmth.

2️⃣ Funny Tab:

Keep only one video:
🎬 URL: https://youtube.com/shorts/LpLM6rxijSc?si=GkzffVEeE5AJdgmD

Caption:

Ensure it’s embedded in the same responsive format as the Story Time video.

3️⃣ Uplifting Tab:

Keep only one video:
🌞 URL: https://youtube.com/shorts/ZwcaFhdjRY4?si=9kiMxR_XQXmOGSUV

Caption:

Maintain the same minimal and rounded video style as the others.

4️⃣ General Video Design Guidelines:

Each category (Story Time, Funny, Uplifting) should show only one video for now.

Center each video with rounded corners (border-radius: 16px) and a light shadow.

Use consistent sizing and spacing across all categories.

Keep captions simple, warm, and easy to read in MoodDrop’s blush/cream palette.

Maintain responsiveness and soft transitions for mobile and desktop.

5️⃣ Final Notes:

Ensure tabs still navigate smoothly.

Verify that no “unavailable” or blank videos appear.

Keep performance optimized for loading speed.
