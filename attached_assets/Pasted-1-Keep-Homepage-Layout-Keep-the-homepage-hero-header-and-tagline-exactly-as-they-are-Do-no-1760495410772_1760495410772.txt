1) Keep Homepage Layout

Keep the homepage hero, header, and tagline exactly as they are.

Do not alter the layout or spacing of the existing “Let It Flow” and “Take a Moment” tabs.

2) Add Mood Selector Row

Add a short header line centered above the mood circles that says:

“What type of mood are you feeling today?”

Use soft, neutral typography consistent with MoodDrop’s existing text style.

Slightly smaller than the main heading, e.g. font-size: 1rem (medium weight).

Mood Circles Design

Add six medium horizontal circles centered under the phrase.

Each circle represents a mood and includes the following details:

Mood	Color	Meaning
Calm	#A6C8FF	Peaceful, centered, emotionally balanced
Grounded	#A4C3A2	Stable, reflective, grateful
Joyful	#FBE694	Happy, excited, hopeful
Tender	#F6C1B4	Loving, affectionate, sensitive
Overwhelmed	#C9C7D2	Tired, unsure, emotionally heavy
Frustrated	#E98A7A	Irritated, tense, needing release
Circle Style

Size: 28px (desktop) / 24px (mobile).

Alignment: horizontal and centered.

Slight glow on hover/focus (box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)), smooth transition.

Equal spacing (8–12px).

Tooltip or label on hover with the mood name + short meaning.

Keyboard accessible with aria-label per circle.

Behavior

When a user clicks a circle:

If Let It Flow is active → show the Write panel + display mood name & meaning above the textarea.

If Take a Moment is active → show the Voice Note option with the selected mood noted.

Add a small Reset Mood button beside the meaning that clears the selection and hides the label (without deleting text).

3) Matching Game Timer

Add a 20-second countdown timer at the top-right corner of the matching game.

Timer starts automatically when the game begins.

On timeout:

Show a message:

“⏳ Time’s up — want to try again?”

Include a soft “Restart” button.

Optional gentle chime sound (no harsh tones).

Timer resets cleanly each new round.

4) Keep All Other Features

Do not change any other homepage elements, animations, or sections.

Maintain the current aesthetic: soft blush and cream tones, subtle shadows, and minimal, airy spacing.

✅ Done Criteria

The homepage keeps its current clean layout.

The text “What type of mood are you feeling today?” appears centered above six glowing mood circles.

Selecting a mood triggers the correct action, showing the mood’s meaning and maintaining reset functionality.

Matching game runs with a working 20s timer, ending gently with a restart option.
