Rebuild The Collective Drop community tab for MoodDrop with full Supabase integration and owner Vibe ID.

Requirements:

1. **Overall Purpose**
   - Recreate The Collective Drop so users can post, reply, and communicate in real time.
   - Use Supabase to store and retrieve posts and replies between users.
   - Keep all data anonymous except for each user's generated Vibe ID.
   - The layout and calm tone must match the existing MoodDrop design (light blush tones, rounded cards, minimal borders).

2. **Vibe ID System**
   - Each visitor automatically gets a generated unique `Vibe_ID` when they post.
   - Vibe IDs are **non-reusable** (once assigned, they stay linked to that device via localStorage).
   - Add my permanent admin Vibe ID: **Charae 💧**
       • This ID is fixed and cannot be generated by others.
       • The droplet emoji must appear directly **beside** the name, not above.
       • Use the existing MoodDrop blush pink droplet color for the 💧 symbol.
       • No pulsing or animation—only a subtle hover glow via opacity transition.

3. **Posts and Replies**
   - Users can:
       • Post a Drop (text + optional mood emoji).
       • Reply to other Drops.
   - All posts and replies are stored in Supabase (table name: `Drops`).
   - Fields: id (UUID), vibe_id (text), text (text), mood (text), created_at (timestamp).
   - Replies reference the parent post’s ID via `reply_to`.

4. **Display**
   - Posts load in descending order (newest first).
   - Each post shows:
       • Vibe ID (or "Anonymous" if missing)
       • Text
       • Mood (optional emoji)
       • Timestamp
       • Reply button → toggles a small input field for Notes of Calm (short replies)
   - Replies nest under each Drop (slightly indented).
   - My posts display `Charae 💧` using the pink droplet asset `/assets/droplet-pink.png`.

5. **Design**
   - Keep the warm neutral background with rounded cards and drop shadows.
   - Use Tailwind classes consistent with the rest of MoodDrop.
   - Button text: “Share Drop 💧”
   - Placeholder: “What’s your vibe today…”

6. **Backend Connection**
   - Read Supabase environment variables:
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - Use `supabase-js` for inserting, fetching, and subscribing to new Drops.

7. **LocalStorage**
   - Save each user’s Vibe_ID locally so it persists across sessions.
   - Prevent regenerating a new Vibe ID unless user refreshes manually.

8. **Owner Highlight**
   - When rendering each post:
       ```
       <div className="flex items-center gap-1.5">
         <span className="font-medium text-warm-gray-800">{drop.vibe_id}</span>
         {drop.vibe_id === "Charae 💧" && (
           <img
             src="/assets/droplet-pink.png"
             alt="Owner"
             className="w-4 h-4 opacity-90 hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity"
           />
         )}
       </div>
       ```
   - This droplet sits directly beside the name.

9. **Notes of Calm (Replies)**
   - Rename “Notes of Calm” → “Reply Vibes”
   - Keep replies short (max 240 characters).
   - Replies post immediately below the related Drop.

10. **Testing**
   - Verify that:
       • Supabase inserts show in the table.
       • Posts and replies sync across devices.
       • Charae 💧 appears only on the owner’s posts.

After building, deploy the update to GitHub → Vercel as normal.
