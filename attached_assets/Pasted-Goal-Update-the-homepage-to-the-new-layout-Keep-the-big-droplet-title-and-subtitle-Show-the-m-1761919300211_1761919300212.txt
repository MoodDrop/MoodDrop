Goal

Update the homepage to the new layout:

Keep the big droplet, title, and subtitle.

Show the mood dots, and when a mood is selected, display its name + one-line description under the dots.

Add a wide “💧 Drop It” button (rounded, warm-peach background) with the blue droplet icon on the left.

Keep the small caption under the button: “Let it out — this space is just for you.”

Remove the two lines of helper text under the mood dots (“Type or speak your thoughts…” and “Your words stay on your device…”).

Files to edit (already in this project)

client/src/pages/Home.tsx (or client/src/pages/index.tsx / client/src/pages/Landing.tsx if that’s where the hero lives)

client/src/lib/moods.ts (only if mood name/description mapping is needed)

Steps

In the homepage component (Home/Landing), find the section below the mood dots.
Delete the two helper paragraphs:

Type or speak your thoughts — every drop helps you grow.

Your words stay on your device — no account needed, fully anonymous.

Right under the mood dots row, render the selected mood label and a soft description. Use this mapping (or import from @lib/moods if you already have it):

const MOOD_INFO: Record<string, { label: string; blurb: string }> = {
  calm:   { label: "Calm",     blurb: "Steady, quiet, relaxed." },
  grounded:{ label: "Grounded", blurb: "Present, steady, grateful." },
  sunny:  { label: "Sunny",    blurb: "Light, optimistic, bright." },
  cloudy: { label: "Cloudy",   blurb: "Soft, thoughtful, inward." },
  tender: { label: "Tender",   blurb: "Loving, affectionate, sensitive." },
  warm:   { label: "Warm",     blurb: "Cozy, open, at ease." },
};


Render only when a mood is selected:

{currentMood && (
  <div className="mt-3 text-center">
    <div className="font-semibold text-warm-gray-800">
      {MOOD_INFO[currentMood]?.label ?? "Your Mood"}
    </div>
    <div className="text-sm text-warm-gray-600">
      {MOOD_INFO[currentMood]?.blurb ?? ""}
    </div>
  </div>
)}


Add the wide “Drop It” button directly below that mood label:

<div className="mt-5 flex justify-center">
  <a
    href="/write"
    className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-2xl px-6 py-3 sm:px-7 sm:py-3.5 bg-peach-300/80 hover:bg-peach-300 text-warm-gray-900 shadow-sm transition"
  >
    <span className="text-sky-500 text-lg">💧</span>
    <span className="font-semibold">Drop It</span>
  </a>
</div>

<p className="mt-2 text-center text-sm text-warm-gray-500">
  Let it out — this space is just for you.
</p>


Make sure the mood dots still set currentMood (no logic changes needed). Keep all existing keyboard/mouse handlers as-is.

Do not change any other parts of the page (nav, hero droplet, title, subtitle remain the same).

Acceptance checks

The two helper lines under the mood dots are gone.

After selecting a mood, you see its name (e.g., Tender) and the one-line description below the dots.

A single wide “💧 Drop It” button appears, with the caption line under it.

Spacing looks like your screenshot (title → subtitle → dots → mood text → button → caption).

No console errors.
