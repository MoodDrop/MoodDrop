Backup first, then restore original Comfort as Calm Studio

Context:
We’re using the existing Vite + React (no Next.js). Please do not add new frameworks. Everything should stay client-side.

Do this:

1) Create a safety backup
# Make a backup branch
git checkout -b backup/calm-studio-restore || true

# Create a backups folder
mkdir -p backups/calm-studio

# Find all files that define or route the Calm Studio / comfort page
# and copy them into a timestamped backup folder.
# (Adjust paths if our repo structure is slightly different.)
TS=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Common locations to back up (copy if they exist)
for p in \
  "client/src/pages/CalmStudio.tsx" \
  "client/src/pages/Comfort.tsx" \
  "client/src/pages/FindYourCalm.tsx" \
  "client/src/routes.tsx" \
  "client/src/App.tsx" \
  "client/src/components/CalmStudio" \
  "client/src/components/Comfort" \
  "client/src/components/FindYourCalm" \
  "client/src/styles/calm-studio.css" \
  "client/src/styles/comfort.css"
do
  if [ -e "$p" ]; then
    mkdir -p "backups/calm-studio/$TS/$(dirname "$p")"
    cp -r "$p" "backups/calm-studio/$TS/$p"
  fi
done

# Commit the backup snapshot
git add backups/calm-studio
git commit -m "Backup: Calm Studio/Comfort before restore ($TS)" || true


If git push is set up, feel free to push the backup branch:

git push -u origin backup/calm-studio-restore || true

2) Restore the original Comfort page as Calm Studio

Goal: Make the page look and behave exactly like your original /comfort page (working YouTube embeds in Watch & Smile, working Soothing Sounds player, and Games), but the page title + nav label should say “Calm Studio”. Route is /calm-studio.

Instructions:

- Reuse the existing code from the original Comfort implementation (the one that had active YouTube embeds and games). 
- Do NOT introduce new libraries.
- Keep the same layout, spacing, and rounded buttons as the original Comfort page.
- Change only the visible title to “Calm Studio”, and use this subtitle:
  “Take a moment to relax and reset. Watch something uplifting, listen to something soothing, or just breathe.”

- Ensure the three sections work exactly as before:
  1) Watch & Smile  → embedded YouTube videos that play in-page
  2) Soothing Sounds → ambient audio player or playlist (same data/embed)
  3) Games          → same working mini-games section

- Routing:
  • New route path: /calm-studio
  • Update the top navigation to link to /calm-studio with the label “Calm Studio”
  • If /comfort still exists, redirect it to /calm-studio (client-side redirect is fine)

- Keep the warm MoodDrop palette and typography consistent with the rest of the app.


File edits (typical Vite + React setup — adjust if your structure differs):

- client/src/pages/CalmStudio.tsx         → (copy of the old Comfort page code, with the new title/subtitle)
- client/src/App.tsx or client/src/routes.tsx
   • Add/ensure route:  <Route path="/calm-studio" element={<CalmStudio />} />
   • If /comfort route exists, redirect it to /calm-studio.

- client/src/components/... 
   • Reuse the same components for Watch & Smile, Sounds, and Games that the Comfort page used.
   • Do NOT replace the working YouTube and audio embeds — keep them as is.

3) Save & Verify
# Format & type-check (if applicable)
npm run check || true

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Restore Comfort page as Calm Studio (same layout & functionality, new title & route)"

# (Optional) push to GitHub to trigger Vercel deploy
git push origin main || true


Manual verification checklist:

Open /calm-studio — page title reads Calm Studio and subtitle is updated.

Watch & Smile: videos are embedded and play in-page.

Soothing Sounds: audio player/playlist works.

Games: the original mini-games load and work.

Navbar link says Calm Studio and goes to /calm-studio.

Visiting /comfort (if still reachable) smoothly redirects to /calm-studio.
