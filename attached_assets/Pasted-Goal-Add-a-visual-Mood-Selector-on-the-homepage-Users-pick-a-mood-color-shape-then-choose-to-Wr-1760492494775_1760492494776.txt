Goal
Add a visual Mood Selector on the homepage. Users pick a mood (color+shape), then choose to Write or Record voice. Show the mood’s meaning when they choose Write. Include a Reset mood control.

1) Mood Palette (color • shape • meaning)

Use these six moods:

Calm — Soft Blue #A6C8FF • Circle • “Peaceful, centered, emotionally balanced.”

Grounded — Sage Green #A4C3A2 • Leaf/Oval • “Stable, reflective, grateful.”

Joyful — Warm Yellow #FBE694 • Star • “Happy, excited, hopeful.”

Tender — Blush Pink #F6C1B4 • Heart • “Loving, affectionate, sensitive.”

Overwhelmed — Lavender Gray #C9C7D2 • Cloud • “Tired, unsure, emotionally heavy.”

Frustrated — Soft Coral Red #E98A7A • Triangle • “Irritated, tense, needing release.”

Arrange as two rows of three icons. Prompt text above:
“What type of mood are you feeling today?”

2) Selection Behavior

Clicking an icon selects the mood (soft highlight/scale + aria-selected).

Reveal two primary actions under the selected mood:

Write (opens text input)

Record voice (opens voice note control)

Keep layout minimal, soft shadows, blush/cream background.

3) “Write” Flow — show meaning

When Write is chosen:

Display the mood name + description above or beside the textarea.

Example:
Calm — peaceful, centered, emotionally balanced.

Show a large, comfy textarea with placeholder:
“Let it flow…”

4) “Record voice” Flow

Show a simple voice recorder (start/stop, timer, playback).

Save file in memory for now (no backend required yet); allow re-record.

5) Reset & Text Safety

Add a secondary “Reset mood” button near the mood label.

On click: clear selected mood + hide description + return to mood grid.

Do not erase any typed text by default (preserve draft).

Optional link: “Clear text” to intentionally wipe the textarea.

6) Accessibility & UX

Icons are keyboard-focusable; Enter/Space selects.

Add aria-label per icon, e.g., “Calm — blue circle.”

Motion: gentle 150–250ms ease-out (respect prefers-reduced-motion).

7) State Model (suggested)
type MoodKey = "Calm"|"Grounded"|"Joyful"|"Tender"|"Overwhelmed"|"Frustrated";
selectedMood: MoodKey | null
draftText: string
recordingState: "idle"|"recording"|"review"

8) Files to touch (example Next.js)

components/MoodSelector.tsx (icons grid + selection)

components/MoodComposer.tsx (Write/Voice UI, meaning display, reset)

lib/moods.ts (export palette: color, shape, meaning)

app/page.tsx or pages/index.tsx (wire it in)

9) Visual Tone

Soft gradients (blush/cream), rounded-2xl corners, subtle shadows.

Icon hover glow is minimal; no harsh colors.

Keep everything calming and uncluttered.

Done criteria

Selecting any of the 6 icons shows actions (Write / Record voice).

Write displays the correct mood meaning and preserves text when mood is reset.

Record voice works (basic start/stop/playback).

Keyboard + screen-reader friendly.

Matches MoodDrop’s calm aesthetic.

Replace color drift game with the matching game.
